# Symfony - Drupal 8

**This is very experimental, whatever you try to do, it will explode. You've been warned.**

For something that actually works, please use https://github.com/makinacorpus/drupal-sf-int instead.

Replaces the DrupalKernel with a Symfony kernel (almost) transparently.

# Getting started

You should not pull this repository, but use http://github.com/makinacorpus/drupal-sf-d8-starter
instead, it will pull all the required dependencies and setup the environment correctly.

# Incompatibilities

 *  you cannot use Drush (yet)
 *  you cannot use Drupal Console (yet)
 *  you cannot use authorize.php
 *  you cannot use the statistics module
 *  you cannot use the core installer
 *  you cannot do multisite anymore (who does this anyway?)
